# Sparse-array-and-matrix
It is about implementation of a Sparse array and matrix (2D) which helps in saving memory and time espically when there is a lot of unused wasted memory.

## Sparse array 1D
It's a data structure used espacially when there is a lot of unused memory and some only is used which may not be avaliable all the time.
So , I made a container which uses only the determined values saving the wasted memory and that is so useful espically in the polynomial functions. it is a good example for the problem and that data structure solves that problem.

## Key features :
1. printing the array
2. printing non zero elements in array
3. adding two arrays
4. setting values in the array
5. getting values from the array


## Sparse matrix 2D
It's a datastructure and the mostly used in the industry . the same idea saves a lot of memory of wasted unused spaces . but the key difference that one for a grid which have columns and rows.
So , another one of the same problem in a differen way solved by that datastructure . to make that datastructure i have used the previous one and that make sense the idea differs because of the implementation of the functions differs.

## Key fearures :
1. printing the 2D array
2. printing the 2D array with non zero elements only
3. adding two matrices
4. setting values for the matrix
5. getting values from the matrix by row and column

##### ***small note the containers are zero based
