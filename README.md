# Sparse-array-and-matrix
It is about implementation of a Sparse array and matrix (2D) which helps in saving memory and time espically when there is a lot of unused wasted memory.

## Sparse array 1D
It's a data structure used espacially when there is a lot of unused memory and some only is used which may not be avaliable all the time.
So , I made a container which uses only the determined values saving the wasted memory and that is so useful espically in the polynomial functions. it is a good example for the problem and that data structure solves that problem.

## Key features :
1. printing the array
2. printing non zero elements in array
3. adding two arrays
4. setting values in the array
5. getting values from the array
